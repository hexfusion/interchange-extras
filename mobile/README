These files provide support for a separate mobile template. You can make
great gains with responsive design, but it doesn't solve all the issues,
namely mobile-friendly checkout pages.


Create a "pages/m/" directory, and add to it the mobile versions of your
pages, if they have different HTML than the corresponding page in the
pages/ dir.

customize i/usertag/is_mobile.tag, if you want to redirect phones and
tablets (default is only phones).

Note that is_mobile expects to see a pages/m/flypage.html and
pages/m/results.html, so you may need to alter the usertag if you don't
use mobile-specifc pages for those.

add to catalog.cfg:
        Autoload [handle-mobile]

add to regular templates (include/layout/leftonly and the like):
        [is-mobile]
        <div style="position:absolute;top:0;right:0;background:white;padding:.5em 1em;text-align:center;font-weight:bold">
                <a href="[area href="[either][data session arg][or][cgi mv_nextpage][/either]" form=gomo=1]">Enter Mobile Site</a>
        </div>
        [/is-mobile]
