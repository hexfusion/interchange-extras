Ctags generates an index (or tag) file of language objects found in source files that allows these items to be quickly and easily located by a text editor or other utility. A tag signifies a language object for which an index entry is available (or, alternatively, the index entry created for that object). 

1. Install exuberant-ctags
	http://ctags.sourceforge.net/

2. 'cd' to your Interchange installation (e.g. /usr/local/interchange)

3. Run:

	ctags -R --exclude='*.js'

4. Use with Vi:

	vi -t tag	Start vi and position the cursor at the file and line where "tag" is defined.
	:ta tag 	Find a tag.
	Ctrl-] 		Find the tag under the cursor.
	Ctrl-T 		Return to previous location before jump to tag (not widely implemented).
