Redirects
---------

Allows for easy entry of redirects, via the Tables tab in the Admin.
This can be used for redirecting from one page to another, from one
product to another, or even for short-URLs
(e.g. www.foo.com/gc --> www.foo.com/Gift-Certificates).

The old link _must_ no longer exist for this to work. That means the
file is removed from disk if a page, or the product is deleted from the
products table if a product.


Install these files in their appropriate directories:

	dbconf/mysql/redirects.mysql
	products/redirects.txt

Alter your <special_pages/missing.html> file by comparing with the one here.

Append to your <products/mv_metadata.asc> file the <products/mv_metadata.redirects> file's contents.
