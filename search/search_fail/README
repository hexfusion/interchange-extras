Log failed search to a database table.

The mv_metadata snippet will sort the table with the most popular
failures first.

For failures that are misspelled items on your site, you could add a
"search_terms" field to your products table, and then enter any failures
with their corresponding item. You will then need to modify your search
forms to query this field along with your existing mv_search_field.
