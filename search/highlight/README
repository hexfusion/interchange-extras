Highlight the search keyword on results pages

I believe the original jQuery plugin was obtained from:
http://www.jquery.info/The-plugin-SearchHighlight

Requires jQuery.

The initial search results page (typically pages/results.html)
displays links to the flypages with matching content. Alter these
links to include the "form" parameter below:

	[area ... form='s=[value-extended name=mv_searchspec]']

Then, in pages/flypage.html, add something like what is included in
flypage.html.snip.

    (Your template may or may not have meta_header and meta_footer
    output sections [the Strap template does].)

Alter the .searchlight style to your liking.

Configure the options block in Javascript to your needs. You can use
these parameters:

    - exact: one of:
        - 'exact' (highlights the word only if it exactly matches)
        - 'whole' (highlights all the words even if there is a partial match)
        - 'partial' (highlights only the part of the word that matches)

    - style_name: The class of the span element that wraps the words to
      be highlighted.

    - style_name_suffix (boolean, default value:true) 
        - True indicates that each style will be incremented with a
          number. (hilite1, highlite2, hilite3...) This is useful to
          find specific matches and style them differently.

    - highlight (jQuery selector or object, default value:null) 
        - Use this option to limit the Highlighting to a specific area
          of the page. Null is the entire document. If no elements are
          found the plugin consider the entire document as well.

    - nohighlight (jQuery selector or object, default value:null) 
        - Use this option to exclude the Highlighting from a specific
          area of the page. It has priority on the highlight option.

    - keys (string, default value:null) 
        - Allows to explicitly set the words to be searched for, while
          disabling all the tests against the referrer. Useful to
          disable search engines highlight and to highlight words
          extracted from page url or from the DOM.
